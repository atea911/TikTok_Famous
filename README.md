# Demystifying TikTok :musical_note:
This project is a part of the [Data Blog](https://datares.github.io/#/datablog) at [DataResolutions](https://datares.github.io/#/).  The article published on this project, along with other articles from Data Blog, can be found on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ucladatares).

## Project Motivation/Description :dizzy:
The purpose of this project is to explore various aspects of TikTokâ€”specifically the demographics of TikTok's most followed users and the analytics of trending videos on TikTok. Questions we wanted to answer include: **Add stuff here**

### Technologies Used :computer:
* R 
* Python
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SeasBorn, jupyter

## Getting Started :page_facing_up:

1. Clone this repository (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/ivantran96/TikTok_famous/tree/main/Datasets) within this repo.  
3. Data processing/visualization scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/ivantran96/TikTok_famous/tree/main/Visualizations)

## Data Collection :open_file_folder:
For the data collection, we had a different method of collection for our trending videos dataset and our top tiktokers dataset.

### Trending Videos

### Top TikTokers
For the collection of the top TikTokers, we use the simple webscraping module on Python [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). The scripts and html pages used can be seen [here](https://github.com/ivantran96/TikTok_famous/tree/main/Datasets/Top%20Tiktokers%20Data%20Collection) in this repo. For the webscraping, we found information for the first 6 columns of our dataset from [InflueceGrid](https://www.influencegrid.com/tiktok-influencers). The remaining information was manually entered, citing sources such as [Famous Birthdays](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/).

This dataset `top-260-tiktokers.csv` looks into the demographics of the top 260 TikTokers and is used to explore possible commanalities of the top influencers on the platform.

It consists of 14 columns:
* `Rank`
* `Username`
* `Country`
* `Followers`
* `Views` (median of 15 most recent videos collected on 10-24-2020)
* `Likes` (median of 15 most recent videos collected on 10-24-2020)
* `Engagement` (Views + Likes + Shares / 15 most recent videos, collected on 10-24-2020)
* `Brand Account` (1 for true, 0 for false)
* `Gender` (Based on what information is public about their identity)
* `Age`
* `Ethnicity`
* `Famous` (1 for if they were already famous before TikTok, 0 for not)
* `Genre` (categories that would define their main content)
* `LBGTQ` (1 if they are a member of the LGBTQ community, 0 if not. Based on what information is public about their identity)

#### get-csv Webscraping
Simply using the get-csv.py script will allow you to obtain the first 6 columns of `top-260-tiktokers.csv`

1. Get the necessary libraries to obtain and parse the html of the data
`pip install beautifulsoup4`
`pip install urllib3`
2. Using `urllib.request` and `BeautifulSoup` you can retrieve the html of any page and make it "parsable". (Note: some sites are secure and can deter you from reading their url)
```
#open a url (my_url should be a string of the url)
uClient = urlopen(my_url)
page_html = uClient.read()
uClient.close()
#save the page as "soup" that can be parsed
page_soup = soup(page_html, "html.parser")
```
3. Following commands from the [BeautifulSoup Documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), you can get the necessary information from the html page and write it into a file (using commas and newline to make it a CSV file).

#### Adding remaining information
We were not able to find a cohesive list of information on the demographics of the top TikTokers, so we manually entered in the remaining columns.

## Data Cleaning 
For the `top-260-tiktokers.csv` dataset, we first removed the unnecessary symbols from our numerical column entries (such as the % or 'm' to indicate a million) and converted those datatypes from object to float. For the remaining columns, the entries were entered in manually so we did not have to clean up any possible duplicate/nonsensical values/entries that appeared in the data.
